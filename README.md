    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Empowering agriculture: Detect paddy leaf diseases early using AI, get precise pesticide recommendations, and classify disease stages. Revolutionize farming with technology.</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to the Paddy Leaf Disease Detection and Management project! Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, and
        paddy rice is a crucial staple crop. This project aims to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive
        solution for early disease detection, pesticide recommendation, and disease stage classification in paddy
        leaves.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Disease Detection:</strong> Our system utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning
            techniques to accurately identify diseases present in paddy leaves. This helps farmers identify problems at an
            early stage and take timely action.</li>
        <li><strong>Pesticide Recommendation:</strong> Based on the detected disease, our system suggests appropriate
            pesticides or treatments. This ensures targeted intervention and reduces the unnecessary use of chemicals,
            promoting sustainable agriculture.</li>
        <li><strong>Disease Stage Classification:</strong> Understanding the stage of disease progression is crucial for
            effective management. Our model classifies the disease stages, providing insights into the severity of the
            issue and assisting in decision-making.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> We've developed an intuitive user interface that makes it easy for
            farmers, agronomists, and researchers to interact with the system. Users can upload images, receive disease
            analysis, and access recommended actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution to Agriculture:</strong> By combining cutting-edge technology with agricultural
            expertise, our project bridges the gap between modern technology and traditional farming, ultimately boosting
            productivity and reducing losses.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>How to Use:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Upload an image of a paddy leaf to the system.</li>
        <li>Receive instant analysis of disease presence and severity.</li>
        <li>Get recommendations for appropriate pesticides or treatments.</li>
        <li>Gain insights into disease stages for effective management.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Contributions:</strong></p>
    <p>We welcome contributions from the open-source community. Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or domain
        expert, your contributions can make a significant impact on global agriculture.</p>
